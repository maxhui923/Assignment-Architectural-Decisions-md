# Title of ADR
Choosing the Backend Language for the Mobile App

## Status
Proposed

## Context
A robust backend language is essential for efficient data processing, API integrations, and overall server-side logic.

## Options Considered
• Node.js
• Python (Django/Flask)
• Ruby on Rails

## Decision
Node.js is selected as the backend language.

## Consequences
Pros of Node.js:
- Non-blocking I/O model, lightweight, and scalable.
- Seamless integration with JavaScript front-end frameworks.

Cons:
- Callback hell (can be mitigated with modern ES features).

## Rationale
Node.js offers high performance and is conducive for developing scalable apps. Its compatibility with React Native streamlines development.

## Follow-Up Actions
- Set up a Node.js server.
- Begin API development and integrations.
